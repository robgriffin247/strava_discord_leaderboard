# Strava Segments Leaderboard to Discord

### Aim 

Use the Strava API to collect effort counts and PR times for segments on Strava for associated users, then generate a leaderboard generating bot in discord.


### Ongoing tasks

- Create python code to collect counts and prs for a given segment and rider
- POC with Alpe du Zwift (id: 17267489) where I should have 50 efforts and a PR of 48:21
- Integrate with other athletes (team or manual ids)
